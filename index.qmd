# Preparation

The workshop will cover the basics of creating shiny web applications. There is no need for prior experience in website development or shiny is required to get the most out of this workshop. Familiarity with writing R code is expected, and being comfortable with using tidyverse packages including dplyr and ggplot2 would be beneficial. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or using the tidyverse, consider working through the learnr materials here: <https://learnr.numbat.space/>.

A [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account is needed to deploy your app to <https://www.shinyapps.io/> in session 3 (but is not required if you just want to watch this part).

## Required equipment

Just a computer capable of running R and an internet connection! ðŸ’»
This workshop will be ran online, so no other equipment is needed.

## Required software

To be able to complete the exercises of this workshop, please make sure to install a suitable IDE (such as RStudio), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages.

-   **Shiny packages and extensions**
    -   shiny
-   **tidyverse packages and friends**
    -   ggplot2, readr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr
-   **data packages**
    -   palmerpenguins

Run this code to install the packages if needed:

```{r}
#| eval: false
packages <- c(
  "shiny",
  "ggplot2", "readr", "tibble", "tidyr",
  "palmerpenguins"
)

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
```
